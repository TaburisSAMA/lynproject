My work log.
# Sunday, 30/11/2008
Today I tested the table interface for a test MIB named 'testmibTable'.
I was able to read the values from it. But I could not set values.

Previously I also created and tested some scalar function. But I was 
unable to set values to them. I have to look what should be done.


Task TODO:
1. I need to print the logs from snmpd.
	//1/12/08 Done.... with agentx...
2. An agentx integration must be done.
	//1/12/08 : Solved... A make file is needed
3. A work plan need to be devised to manage such a huge code.
	//is under construction
4. Need to implement Table with RowStatus.
5. How to debug the code. probably from eclipse.


mibtestTable:
generate the code from
mib2c -c mib2c.mfd.conf mibtestTable


there is a potential bug in mibtestTable supplied from Don Tu. 
I fixed it by "netSnmpExamples 10"

the changes are marked with //Max

Changes are done in (as per DT) 
1. mibtestTable_data_access.c
2. mibtestTable_data_set.c
3. mibtestTable.c
3. mibtestTable.h

But Set is not working. Also initial values are not working.
It should be 
0 	100 	200
0 	-100 	-200

but I am getting 0 1 2, 0 -1 -2.... Have to see what is wrong.

I am working on 5.3.1 version. 
May need to switch to latest 5.4.1 version.
 
Probable task
1. Add database support to snmpd


Search for community option in net to set snmp value.

# 01/12/2008
Set Access:
in the snmpd.conf I have to declare readwrite community for set access.
Type the following lines.

------------------
rwcommunity public
------------------

rocommunity for readonly community

AgentX:
for mfd style it's easy.
type:
[root@localhost ~]# mib2c -c subagent.m2c mibtestTable
[root@localhost ~]# mib2c -c mfd-makefile.m2m mibtestTable

Now to use gcc make uncomment:
NETSNMPCFLAGS := $(shell $(NETSNMPCONFIG) --base-cflags)
NETSNMPLIBS := $(shell $(NETSNMPCONFIG) --agent-libs)
and comment the next two lines.


Now its time for traps and rowstatus table.

#23/12/2008
After a lot of days I began working again on Net-SNMP.

Now a framework is under development.
