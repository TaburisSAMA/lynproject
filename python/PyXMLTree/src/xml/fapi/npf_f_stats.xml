<descr>
This structure lists statistics that should be added to the counted statistics
pool, statistics that should be deleted from the counted statistics pool,
and statistics that should be reset. All operations are provided
in the form of a bitmask with each bit in a bitmask representing one supported statistic.
The first statistic in a "read statistics value" structure is represented
by the first LSB. Bits that do not have a corresponding statistic are not analyzed.
Particular statistics can have only one operation executed upon it. A bit
can be set either in an "add" bitmask or a "delete" or "reset" bitmask. Operation
that does not change the state of a statistic is skipped (e.g., adding a statistic
that is already in the counted statistics pool).
